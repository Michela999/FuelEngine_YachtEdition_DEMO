FuelEngine Yacht Edition — DEMO

FuelEngine Yacht Edition DEMO is a simplified version of the full FuelEngine PRO system used for yacht engine performance analysis, fuel optimization, and air-risk detection.
This demo is designed to showcase the workflow, structure, and capabilities of the full product without exposing proprietary models, algorithms, or premium features.

🚀 What the DEMO Includes

This DEMO provides:

A sample project structure identical to the PRO version

Example placeholder scripts (non-functional) for:

Data ingestion

Feature engineering

Report generation

Lightweight dummy datasets for demonstration

Documentation explaining how the full PRO system works

A PRO-style output folder to show real deliverables (reports, plots, summaries)

The DEMO allows users to understand how FuelEngine operates — but does not include:

The trained machine-learning model

Proprietary risk algorithms

Real datasets

Executable predictive analytics

The PRO engine analyzer logic

🔒 Protected Premium Components

To safeguard intellectual property, the DEMO uses:

Redacted code files

Mock functions instead of ML logic

Dummy values for reports and plots

No model weights or training pipelines

No proprietary datasets

This ensures you can share and display the project publicly without exposing sensitive or commercial assets.
